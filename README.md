## CS418 - Introduction to Data Science
### UIC - Spring '23

<br>In this lab, we work on a datasets from Divvy which we join and calculate statistical information for each of the features, and then clean the dataset and calculate the same statistical information to see if the cleaning resulted in any changes. We also find out the maximum rides taken in a day after we have performed our cleaning.
